## Installation and Setup

Installing the extension is pretty easy and straight forward: import/install the TYPO3 extension “Nagios”, configure the features you want to monitor/expose, and grant access to access the data to the Nagios® server by providing the server's IP address or fully qualified host name.

Please review the [system requirements](SystemRequirements/Index.md) and make sure that the extension works in your TYPO3 instance and on your server. Then, follow the [step-by-step installation](StepByStep/Index.md) guide. If you plan to update the extension from an old version, refer to the chapter “[Version Updates](VersionUpdates/Index.md)”.

Last but not least, install and configure the [Nagios® server plugin](NagiosServerPlugin/Index.md).
