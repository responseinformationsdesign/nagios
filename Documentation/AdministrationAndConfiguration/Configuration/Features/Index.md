**Option:**
: Loaded Extensions Only

**Output example:**
: *see above*

**Description:**
: Enable or disable the feature to limit the extension list to loaded extensions only (not recommended). See additional notes below.

**Default:**
: **☐** disabled

**Additional notes:**
: TYPO3 has the concept of *installed* and *loaded* (or *activated*) extensions. When you install an extension, the files are copied to the extension directory (for example `typo3conf/ext/example`). This does not *load* the extension code in the TYPO3 instance necessarily. The code base exists and is available but possibly not used yet. You have to *activate* the extension so that TYPO3 uses it.
: From a security perspective, unused code (for example TYPO3 extensions) should not exist in the system at all. The extension list generated by the TYPO3 extension “Nagios” contains all extensions by default, no matter if they are activated or just installed.
: You can exclude inactive extensions from the list by enabling the feature “**Loaded Extensions Only**”.
: > Please note that this configuration possibly weakens the security of your TYPO3 environment as your monitoring solution may not take all extensions installed in your TYPO3 instance into account.
